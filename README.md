I'm a life-long dev, having first experiment with HTML as a kid and have been gradually picking up more skills and toolsets as I've gone along. My most well-known work is in the video streaming domain, having worked on the JavaScript client on Disney+, among others.

I'm currently learning some back-end web development skills and am looking for work in just about anything that's within my skillset. If you're interested in knowing more about me/making job enquiries, take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-buggy-bb5b1330a/).
